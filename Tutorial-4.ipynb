    "    - All classes' names begin with an upper case letter\n",
    "    - Methods and variables names begin with a lower case letter and if they consist of several words the words should be concatenated where the second and subsequent words should start with an upper case letter; ex: minValue, addNumbers\n",
    "    - Methods names are always start with a verb; ex: findMaxmimum \n",
